## Abstract
The aim of this project is to develop a machine learning model that predicts the cost of medical insurance for individuals based on various demographic and health-related factors. Accurate prediction of medical insurance costs can help insurance providers and individuals make informed decisions regarding coverage and financial planning. The model utilizes historical data on individuals' attributes such as age, gender, BMI, smoking habits, region, and number of dependents to train and predict the future medical insurance cost.
## Introduction
This project aims to develop a machine learning model that predicts insurance charges based on individual attributes such as age, BMI, smoking habits, and region. By accurately estimating insurance charges, insurance companies can make informed decisions, improve risk assessment, and provide personalized insurance quotes to customers. The project utilizes a dataset containing relevant information and follows a standard machine learning workflow, including data preprocessing, feature selection/engineering, model training, evaluation, and fine-tuning. The ultimate goal is to enhance pricing accuracy, fairness, and customer satisfaction in the insurance industry.
## Problem Statement
Insurance companies often struggle with determining appropriate insurance charges for their customers. Manual calculations may not account for the complexity of various factors affecting insurance costs, leading to potential inaccuracies and unfair pricing. This project aims to develop a predictive model that leverages machine learning techniques to accurately estimate insurance charges based on individual attributes.
## Model selection
Various machine learning algorithms, such as linear regression, decision trees, random forests, or gradient boosting, will be explored to identify the most suitable model for insurance charge prediction. The model will be selected based on its ability to handle the specific characteristics of the dataset and its performance metrics.
## Tools
Numpy,
Pandas,
Matplotlib,
Seaborn,
Scikit learn
## conclusion
- The Gradient Boosting Regressor and Extra Tree Regressor are the top-performing models among the options listed. Both models achieved a score of 85.411672, indicating a high level of accuracy in the regression task.
- The Random Forest Regressor, with a score of 83.392921, also performed well but slightly lower than the top two models. It can still be considered a viable option, especially if the performance difference is negligible or if other factors such as interpretability or model complexity are taken into account.¶
- On the other hand, the Linear Regression model obtained the lowest score of 71.503664, suggesting lower accuracy compared to the other models. While Linear Regression can be a simple and interpretable baseline, it may not be the best choice for this specific task, given the available alternatives.
